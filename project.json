DM me if you spotted any Bugs :)\r\n\r\n[b]The Board Wallpaper[/b]\r\n\r\n[u]CONTAINMENT PROCEDURE[/u]:\r\n\r\nObject should be contained and digitally anchored at Steam Workshop.\r\n\r\n[u]DESCRIPTION/PARAUTILITY[/u]:\r\n\r\nThe object is a standard webpage written in HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla Javascript, and could be utilized as desktop wallpaper through the software \"Wallpaper Engine\". Some of its behaviors could be customized through its properties menu.\r\n\r\nWhen bound, the object serves as an indirect link to [spoiler]the Astral Plane[/spoiler] through [spoiler]the Hotline[/spoiler] (refer to file [spoiler]OOP3-UE[/spoiler]). This allows [spoiler]parautilitarians[/spoiler] to receive transmission directly from [spoiler]the Board[/spoiler], without the potential side-effects of directly binding to [spoiler]the Hotline[/spoiler]. Some [spoiler]parautilitarians[/spoiler] report being contacted by other [spoiler]Astral entities[/spoiler] other than [spoiler]the Board[/spoiler] when bound to the object. \r\n\r\nThe object is also seemingly capable of altering the [spoiler]hyperreal transmission[/spoiler] of [spoiler]the Board[/spoiler]. By altering the text field of its properties, using \">\" to break sentences and \">>\" to break paragraphs, [spoiler]parautilitarians[/spoiler] are able to completely alter the message transmitted by [spoiler]the Board[/spoiler].\r\n\r\nThe object has no current binder.",
